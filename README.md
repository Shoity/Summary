## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [SaSS](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I learned a lot about the usage of SaSS since it i my firt project with it!
Besides that, the React part was excellent training for me as I could use the data from a JSON() file to make a more dynamic web page.

### Useful resources

- [React Mockup](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react#start-with-the-mockup) - The way you start a project will define the paths to the end, so Get off on the right foot is the way! This link helped me with this!
